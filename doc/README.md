# Documentation

This folder contains all the documents that explained the reason of choosing algorithms, features, etc.

I will not discuss about the style of codes or the way to construct codes -- official documents form `Python`, `Rust`, `Django` or the communities like `Stack Overflow` have done much better work than me.
